# Covact Application Documentation: COVID Data Visualization and Contact Management

This documentation provides an overview and usage instructions for the COVID Data Visualization and Contact Management application. The application allows users to visualize COVID-19 cases data using line graph and a Leaflet map, as well as manage contacts with basic information such as first name, last name, and status (active/inactive). The application utilizes technologies such as Redux for contact data management, React Query for data fetching, React Leaflet for map rendering, and Chart.js for chart visualization.

  

## Features

### 1. COVID-19 Data Visualization

  

 - Line Graph: The application fetches COVID-19 historical cases data
   from an external API and displays it using a line graph. The line
   graph showcases the fluctuation of cases over time, including the
   number of cases, deaths, and recoveries.
 - Leaflet Map: The application utilizes the Leaflet library to render
   an interactive map with markers representing COVID-19 data for
   different regions or countries.

### 2. Contact Management

 - Contact Form: Users can add new contacts by providing their first   
   name, last name, and status (active/inactive). The form allows users 
   to enter contact information and submit it for storage and display.
 - Contact List: The application displays a list of all contacts entered
   by the user. The list includes the first name, last name, and status 
   of each contact.
   
## API Documentation: COVID-19 Data Endpoints

This API documentation provides details about the COVID-19 data endpoints used in the application. These endpoints provide country-specific data on COVID-19 cases and historical graph data for cases with dates. The endpoints are accessed using the following URLs:

### Country Specific Data of Cases
